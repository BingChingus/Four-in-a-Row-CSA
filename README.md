# Four-in-a-Row-CSA
This is a Four-in-a-Row/Connect 4 game that I had to do for APCSA, although I would like to think I would've created one later anyway due to my recent interest in connect 4. I will later move this into my APCSA repository, as Im still getting the hang of github. Improvements can be made like adding more precise verification of tile placements and smaller optimizations in general, but that is a future me problem.

This program consists of a few files:
GameRunner class just creates a board object and instantiates the game,
Game class consists of the game logic (when players go, checking for wins, etc.)
Board class consists of the logic for the game logic (how to place the tile, how to check for wins, etc.)
