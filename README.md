# Four-in-a-Row-CSA
This is a Four-in-a-Row/Connect 4 game that I had to do for APCSA, although I would like to think I would've created one later anyway due to my recent interest in connect 4. I will later move this into my APCSA repository, as Im still getting the hang of github. Improvements can be made like adding increased verification of tile placements and smaller optimizations in general, but that is a a future me problem.
